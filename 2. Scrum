SCRUM 
> Scrum is not an acronym, the name is taken from the sport of Rugby. 

> analogy where Team workstogether to successfully develop software. 

> Definition: Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for application or product development. 
  The development of the project is achieved through iterative cycles known as Sprints. 

* At the start of each Sprint, a cross-functional team selects items from Product Backlog and commits to complete the items by the end of that particular Sprint. 
* Every day the team gathers for a short meeting to discuss the progress and road blocks, if any. 
* At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the work product with stakeholders and demonstrates what has been built. 
* The feedback is then incorporated in the subsequent Sprint. 
* At the end of each Sprint, Scrum emphasizes that the integrated working software is fully tested, and potentially made shippable.
* The Sprints are strictly time-boxed and occur sequentially. The end date of a Sprint does not get extended,regardless of the completion of the work initially planned
